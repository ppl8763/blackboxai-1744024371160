# User Workspace API

## Project Overview
User Workspace API is a web application that provides a platform for user authentication and event management. Built using Node.js, Express, and SQLite, this API allows users to create and manage events and user accounts seamlessly.

## Installation
To get started with the User Workspace API, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set up your environment variables as needed.

4. **Initialize the database**:
   The database will be initialized automatically when the server starts.

## Usage
To start the User Workspace API, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:8000` or the port specified in your environment variables.

### API Endpoints
- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Login for existing users

- **Events Management**:
  - `GET /api/events`: Retrieve all events
  - `POST /api/events`: Create a new event
  - `PUT /api/events/:id`: Update an existing event
  - `DELETE /api/events/:id`: Delete an event

## Features
- User registration and authentication using password hashing.
- CRUD operations for events including title, description, date, time, and location.
- Support for CORS and JSON responses.
- Static file serving for front-end applications.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are utilized in this project:
- `bcryptjs`: For password hashing
- `body-parser`: To parse incoming request bodies
- `cors`: Enables CORS for the API
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file
- `express`: Web framework for Node.js
- `jsonwebtoken`: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens
- `sqlite3`: Lightweight database for storing user and event data

You can check the complete list and versions in the `package.json` file.
